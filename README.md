# 🌌 HorizonProjects-site

Welcome to my digital lab.  
This is the place where I’m building all things Horizon — from a custom browser to a new scripting language, plus whatever strange tools I dream up along the way.

It’s all still in motion, but if you’re into browser customization, scripting, or creative dev experiments, I think you’ll like what’s coming.

## 🚧 Projects in Progress

### 🌐 HorizonNet  
A browser prototype based on Chromium, rebuilt to support scripting natively through CoreScript. Imagine launching automation from the new tab page.

### 🧠 CoreScript  
A personal scripting language project — lightweight, fast, and ideal for browser-driven workflows. It borrows nostalgia from legacy tech but leans into modern use.

### 🚀 More Experiments  
New ideas roll in fast: script launchers, UI mockups, retro-style dev consoles. The site is a hub for testing and shaping them.
